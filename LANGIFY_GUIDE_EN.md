## üîß Troubleshooting

### File Upload Error
- **Symptom**: "CSV files must have at least 4 columns" error
- **Solution**: Verify correct Export from Langify

### Character Encoding Issues
- **Symptom**: Non-English characters appear garbled
- **Solution**: Save file with UTF-8 encoding

### Merged File Record Count Mismatch
- **Symptom**: More or fewer records than expected
- **Solution**:
  - Check record counts for each category in Summary tab
  - Review merge options
  - Verify in Preview

### Source Option Selection Error
- **Symptom**: "Please select only ONE source option" error
- **Solution**: Select only one between "Use File B's source" and "Keep File A's source"

## üìä Technical Details

### Comparison Logic
- **Key**: ID + Name (combination of 2 columns)
- **Change Detection**: Compare Source (3rd column) and Translation (4th column)
- **Before/After**: Display both pre and post change values

### Merge Logic
```
Merged file =
  Unchanged records (based on Live)
  + Changes according to selected options
```

1. Include all Live records by default
2. Apply changes based on user selection
3. Source changes: choose use_a/use_b/skip
4. Maintain original column structure in final output

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens if I swap File A and File B?**
A: Comparison will work but merge results may differ from intention. Always put latest Live as File A.

**Q: What if I don't select either Source option?**
A: Those records will be excluded from merge and require manual processing.

**Q: What are "Both Changes"?**
A: Records where both Source and Translation have been modified.

**Q: Can I compare the merged file again?**
A: Yes, you can upload the merged file as File B for another comparison.

**Q: How do I know which file is newer for Source changes?**
A: If you exported File A recently from live store and edited File B locally, then A is newer for Source. If you edited Product descriptions in Shopify after exporting File A, then B is newer.

**Q: Can I undo a merge?**
A: The tool doesn't modify your original files. You can always re-run the comparison and merge with different options.

**Q: What's the difference between this and the CLI tool?**
A: This web tool is specifically designed for Langify workflows with merge functionality. The CLI tool (`csv_compare.py`) is a general-purpose CSV comparison utility.
